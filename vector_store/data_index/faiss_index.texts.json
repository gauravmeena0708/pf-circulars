        "Introduction to Synthetic Tabular Data Generation L Synthetic tabular data generation is the process of creating artificial datasets that mimic the statistical properties and structure of real-world tabular data: This field has gained prominence due to the increasing need to overcome limitations associated with real data, such as: Data Scarcity: Real-world datasets, especially in specialized domains, can be limited in size. Privacy Concerns: Strict regulations like GDPR and CCPA restrict the use and sharing of sensitive information Class Imbalance: Datasets often have an imbalanced representation of different classes, which can bias machine learning models. Missing Values: Incomplete data is a common issue that complicates modeling efforts. Generative models; including traditional statistical methods, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) , Genera- tive Adversarial Networks (GANs) , Diffusion Models, and Large Language Models (LLMs), are employed to learn the underlying distribution of real data and produce high-fidelity, privacy-preserving synthetic samples. The goal is to generate data that is not only statistically similar but also useful for downstream tasks like machine learning model training; data augmentation; and software testing: Key Objective: To learn the statistical distribution of an existing tabular dataset (De) and produce a synthetic dataset (Ds , that closely approximates it, often represented as Ds pe ( De). 2",
        "Core Challenges in Tabular Data Synthesis 2 Generating high-quality synthetic tabular data is inherently more challenging than synthesizing other data types like images O text due to the unique characteristics of tabular data: These challenges can be broadly categorized: Data Quality Issues of Original Data Limited Data Size: Small datasets; common in specialized fields like healthcare O1 finance, make it difficult for generative models to learn robust distributions. Imbalanced Class Distribution: Severe class imbalances can lead to models that poorly repre- sent minority classes_ Missing Values: The presence of missing entries necessitates models that can handle incomplete information effectively during the learning process. 2.1 2.2 Inherent Characteristics of Tabular Data Heterogeneity: Tabular   data consists of  mixed data types   (numerical,  categorical, ordinal; boolean; etc.) , each with distinct statistical properties, making joint distribution modeling complex_ Direct adaptation of models designed for homogeneous data (like images) is often insufficient _ Complex and Sparse Feature Dependencies:  Capturing the intricate correlations between various features (e.g , numerical-categorical dependencies) is crucial but difficult, especially since these relationships are often sparse. Mixed-Type Single Features: A single column might contain values of different data types (e.g , numerical and categorical labels mixed together) , further complicating encoding and modeling: 2.3 Complex and Diverse Data Distributions Non-Gaussian Distribution of Numerical Features: Numerical features often do not follow Gaussian distributions, exhibiting skewness; heavy tails, Or multiple modes_ Imbalanced Categories in Categorical Features: Categorical columns frequently have domi- nant categories, which can lead to models overfitting these majority classes_ Varied Marginal Effects of Columns: The meaning of a value can change based on the feature context (e:g , 10' could be an age O1 rating) , and preserving these semantic distinctions is vital: Domain-Specific Constraints: Real-world tabular data often has implicit O explicit constraints (e.g , age cannot be negative; certain medical values must be within realistic ranges) that models need to respect_",
        "Methods for Generating Synthetic Tabular Data 3 Synthetic tabular data generation methods are broadly categorized into traditional methods, diffusion models; and LLM-based methods. Traditional Generation Methods 3.1 These include early statistical and machine learning approaches, as well as VAEs and GANs. 3.1.1 Machine Learning-based Methods Before deep generative models, techniques like Copulas, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) , and Bayesian Networks were used. Resampling methods like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) and its variants were also common for addressing class imbalance.   However , these often struggle with high-dimensional data and complex distributions 3.1.2 VAE-based Methods Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) learn a latent representation of data by optimizing an Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO). Models like TVAE adapt VAEs for tabular data, while GOGGLE uses Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) within a VAE framework to model feature dependencies. VAEs can sometimes produce blurry or less sharp outputs compared to other deep generative models. 3.1.3 GAN-based Methods Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) use generator and a discriminator in a min-max game to produce realistic samples. Traditional GANs for Tabular Data: Early adaptations like TGAN used LSTMs for sequential feature generation: MedGAN focused on EHR data, and TableGAN incorporated CNNs. These models made strides but sometimes faced challenges with mixed data types and mode collapse. Conditional GANs (CGANs): These extend GANs by allowing  generation  conditioned on specific attributes o classes (e.g , CTGAN, CTAB-GAN): This is useful for imbalanced data and targeted generation Differentially Private GANs (DP-GANs): To address privacy; methods like DPGAN and PATE-GAN incorporate  differential privacy mechanisms; often by adding noise to gradients or using ensembles of discriminators. CTAB-GAN+ uses Renyi Differential Privacy (RDP for tighter privacy bounds_ 3.2 Diffusion Model Methods Diffusion models have emerged as powerful alternatives, addressing issues like training instability and mode collapse seen in GANs. They learn to reverse gradual noising process. 3.2.1 DDPM-based Methods (Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models) These models define a forward diffusion (noising, process and a reverse denoising process Generic Tabular DDPMs: TabDDPM was a pioneering work extending DDPMs to tabular data, often using separate diffusion processes for numerical (Gaussian diffusion) and categorical features (multinomial diffusion). CoDi uses two co-evolving diffusion models that condition 0n each other: AutoDiff maps heterogeneous features to a continuous latent space using an autoencoder before applying diffusion. TABDIFF proposes a joint continuous-time diffusion process with feature-wise learnable noise schedules_ Domain-Specific DDPMs: These models are tailored for specific  domains. For  healthcare, TabDDPM-EHR , DPM-EHR, and FLEXGEN-EHR (handles missing modalities) generate Elec- tronic Health Records (EHRs) . In finance, EntTabDiff generates data conditioned 0n entities; and",

        "3.2.2 Score-based Generative Models (SGMs) These models learn the score function (gradient of the log-density) of the data distribution and use it to define and reverse continuous-time diffusion trajectory via Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs). SOS was an early SGM for tabular data oversampling: STaSy uses self-paced learning and fine-tuning for stable training: MissDiff trains diffusion models on data with missing values by masking the regression loss. Forest-VP /Forest-Flow employs XGBoost instead of neural networks to estimate scores, naturally handling missing data. TABSYN operates in VAE-learned latent space. Diffusion models, while powerful, can be computationally intensive, especially for high-dimensional data and during sampling: 3.3 LLM-based Methods Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored for tabular data generation due to their ability to understand context; semantics, and incorporate implicit knowledge. 3.3.1 Prompt-based Methods These methods leverage the in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of LLMs, guiding generation through carefully designed prompts that include task descriptions, column meanings, examples; and generation instructions, without fine-tuning the LLM itself: EPIC uses balanced; grouped samples and specific formatting in prompts to generate data, even for imbalanced datasets_ CLLM focuses on data augmentation in low-data scenarios using LLM priors and a curation mech- anism LITO is an oversampling framework that progressively masks and imputes features to synthesize minority samples . GReaT converts tabular data rows into natural language sentences, fine-tunes an LLM, and then uses it for generation; allowing arbitrary conditioning: (Note: GReaT involves fine-tuning, but its prompting aspect for generation is also significant). 3.3.2 Fine-Tuning Methods To improve alignment with tabular data structure and constraints, LLMs are often fine-tuned on specific tabular datasets_ GReaT fine-tunes autoregressive LLMs 0n serialized table data. TabMT uses BERT-based masked transformer for generation TAPTAP employs tabular data pre-training to enhance prediction and generation HARMONIC uses an instruction fine- -tuning dataset based on k-nearest neighbors to help LLMs learn inter-row relationships_ AIGT uses metadata (descriptions, schemas as prompts during fine-tuning and generation_ DP-LLMTGen focuses 0n differentially private tabular data synthesis through two-stage fine- tuning process with a novel loss function The hallucination  problem\" in LLMs can  lead to flawed or   unrealistic samples, necessitating post- processing:",
        "Post-Processing of Synthetic Data Generated synthetic data, especially from LLMs, may contain unrealistic Or incorrect instances (e.g , negative age, violations of common sense)_ Post-processing aims to enhance data quality and ensure alignment with human knowledge Or domain-specific constraints. 4 4.1 Sample Enhancement This involves modifying feature values O filtering out unreasonable samples. 4.1.1 Sample Filtering Methods design criteria based on learning dynamics (confidence scores; impact functions to filter out low-quality or problematic samples. LITO uses self-authentication with rejection sampling; where the LLM validates its own generated samples. 4.1.2 Sample Correction This approach incorporates domain knowledge; often as constraints Or rules; to correct samples. C-DGM LL: Adds a layer to the generative model to restrict output to space defined by linear inequalities, guaranteeing constraint satisfaction: DGM+DRL DRL: Extends this to handle more complex constraints (e.g-, disjunctions of linear inequalities) using Quantifier-Free Linear Real Arithmetic (QFLRA) formulas, allowing for non- convex output spaces_ 4.2 Label Enhancement This aims to correct potential annotation errors in synthetic samples. Manual Re-labeling: Actively selecting low-confidence samples for human re-annotation; though costly: Proxy Model Approach: Using automated models to refine labels. TAPTAP and AIGT use discriminative model trained on original data to generate pseudo-labels for synthetic features. Pred-LLM prompts an LLM to generate labels after generating features:",
        "Evaluating Synthetic Tabular Data 5 Evaluation is crucial and is typically multifaceted, focusing on data availability/utility and privacy: 5.1 Data Availability Utility This assesses the usefulness and realism of the synthetic data. Machine Learning (ML) Efficiency Utility The Train on Synthetic, Test on Real\" (TSTR) protocol is common. A model trained on synthetic data is evaluated on a real test set and its performance (e.g , accuracy; Fl-score; RMSE) is compared to a model trained on real data.

        "Future Directions and Open Challenges Despite progress, several areas require further research: Trade-off Between Data Utility/ Availability and Privacy: Finding the right balance re mains key challenge: Many models excel in one aspect but compromise on the other. Alignment with Human Knowledge and Domain Constraints:  Ensuring synthetic data is not just statistically similar but also semantically correct and compliant with real-world logic is crucial, especially with the rise of neuro-symbolic AI. Current methods for enforcing complex constraints are still developing: Enhanced Interpretability and Fairness: Generative models are often black boxes and can inherit Or amplify biases from training data. Developing interpretable and fair generation methods is vital. FairTabDDPM is an example addressing fairness_ Scalability and Efficiency: Diffusion models, in particular, can be computationally intensive for large, high-dimensional datasets and slow at sampling: Efficient training and sampling techniques are needed. Standardized Evaluation Metrics and Benchmarks: Consistent and comprehensive evalua- tion is complicated by the diversity of data and tasks. More standardized benchmarks are needed, especially for domain-specific quality aspects. Modeling Complex Dependencies and Heterogeneity: Accurately capturing dependencies between mixed-type features and handling very high-dimensional sparse data remain ongoing chal- lenges. Hybrid Models: Combining strengths of different architectures (e.g-, VAEs/GANs with diffusion models or LLMs) could lead to more robust solutions. AutoDiff (Autoencoder Diffusion) is one such example_ Cross-Modality Integration: Exploring how tabular  diffusion  models can be combined with models for other data types (image; text, time-series) for cross-modal applications. Advanced Post-Processing: Developing more sophisticated post-processing techniques to refine synthetic data, correct errors, and ensure logical consistency beyond current methods. Handling  Small and Imbalanced Datasets: While some methods address this (e.g;, SOS, LITO), robust generation from very  limited Or   extremely imbalanced data is still significant hurdle. Concluding Remarks Synthetic tabular data generation is dynamic and critical field.   Addressing the outlined chal- lenges and exploring future directions will be key to unlocking the full potential of synthetic data acIOSs various domains, enabling data-driven innovation while respecting privacy and ensuring data quality",
