        "REVIEWING OUTCOMES To increase the likelihood of success, it is   essential to include formal means for assessment and feedback: The intention is to reassure the mentee about their progress and keep track of the learning curve: Assessment should be supportive, involving informal dialogue with a mentee to check progress against agreed targets or objectives. It includes advice, feedback and ongoing support to mentees to maintain interaction, motivation and progress. Even after formal training is over.

        "3. CHANGING ROLE AS FACILITATORS The role of Enforcement Officers has undergone significant changes in recent years. With the increasing complexity of business and regulatory environments, inspectors are being called upon to play a more strategic role in ensuring compliance with laws and regulations The following are some ofthe ways in which the role of inspectorshas evolved in India: Increased emphasis on risk-based inspection: Inspectors are now focused on identifying areas of highest risk and allocating their resources accordingly: This requires a greater understanding of the business operations being inspected and the underlying risks and challenges. Use of technology: Inspectors are making use of technology such as mobile devices, data analytics, and other tools to streamline their work and improve the efficiency and accuracy oftheirinspections. Collaborative approach: Inspectors are working more closely with businesses to understand their operations and identify areas for improvement: This helps to build trust andreduce therisk of conflict between businessesand regulators. Greater focus on preventive measures: Inspectors are focusing on helping businesses identify and prevent problems before they occur; rather than just detecting and correcting problems afterthefact. Professional development: Inspectors are being encouraged to pursue ongoing professional development to stay current with developments in their  field and to continuously improve their skills. In summary, the role of inspectors in India has shifted from being purely enforcement- focused to being more collaborative, risk-based, and preventive in nature: Thus, Inspectors are now seen as partners or facilitators in promoting compliance and improving business",
