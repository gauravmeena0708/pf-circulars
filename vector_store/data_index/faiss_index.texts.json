        "REVIEWING OUTCOMES To increase the likelihood of success, it is   essential to include formal means for assessment and feedback: The intention is to reassure the mentee about their progress and keep track of the learning curve: Assessment should be supportive, involving informal dialogue with a mentee to check progress against agreed targets or objectives. It includes advice, feedback and ongoing support to mentees to maintain interaction, motivation and progress. Even after formal training is over.

        "3. CHANGING ROLE AS FACILITATORS The role of Enforcement Officers has undergone significant changes in recent years. With the increasing complexity of business and regulatory environments, inspectors are being called upon to play a more strategic role in ensuring compliance with laws and regulations The following are some ofthe ways in which the role of inspectorshas evolved in India: Increased emphasis on risk-based inspection: Inspectors are now focused on identifying areas of highest risk and allocating their resources accordingly: This requires a greater understanding of the business operations being inspected and the underlying risks and challenges. Use of technology: Inspectors are making use of technology such as mobile devices, data analytics, and other tools to streamline their work and improve the efficiency and accuracy oftheirinspections. Collaborative approach: Inspectors are working more closely with businesses to understand their operations and identify areas for improvement: This helps to build trust andreduce therisk of conflict between businessesand regulators. Greater focus on preventive measures: Inspectors are focusing on helping businesses identify and prevent problems before they occur; rather than just detecting and correcting problems afterthefact. Professional development: Inspectors are being encouraged to pursue ongoing professional development to stay current with developments in their  field and to continuously improve their skills. In summary, the role of inspectors in India has shifted from being purely enforcement- focused to being more collaborative, risk-based, and preventive in nature: Thus, Inspectors are now seen as partners or facilitators in promoting compliance and improving business",

The benefits that would accrue to members using FAT include foolproof validation of Aadhaar data as all data of user is pre-E populated directly from Aadhaar database and completion of UAN activation process during UAN generation itself: There would be no requirement for initiation of UAN activation process afresh: By  availing this   facility member would gain immediate access to EPFO services such as passbook viewing, KYC updates, claim submission etc: A detailed User Manual in this regard is enclosed herewith: [This has the approval of CPFC] Yours sincerely,",

Accordingly, there should not be any transfer out of PPO due to branch of the bank in which the pensioner has the account, being located outside the jurisdiction of the concerned RO or the bank not having pension disbursement agreement with the concerned RO. While processing pension claim, any such new branch/bank shall be mandatorily added in bank master with its IFSC and the required data fields of Pension Payment Disbursement Account Number & Service charge disbursement Account Number values as zero for such new entries in the system: 3 The member applying for pension claim may be informed that they can also choose same bank account number as per their UAN-KYC used for PF claim in pension claim also. It is advisable to avoid failure/wrong payment due to bank account related errors. 4. It is reiterated that due care shall be taken while entering IFSC and bank account details of beneficiaries for processing of pension claims: The concerned section shall process the claim accordingly: 5. The PPOs for cases included in CPPS are required to be sent only to concerned pensioners and not to the branch: For all such cases, an undertaking in the attached format shall also be taken from the pensioners within one month of receiving pension claim. For offline claims (e.g: death cases) the undertaking may be taken with claim itself. 6 Also, it must be ensured that for all new PPOs issued, Aadhaar must be seeded in the system for all the beneficiaries so that in future, there would be no issue in DLC submission for the pensioner. All ROs are advised to submit Aadhar details of the beneficiaries at the time of pension claims and to make sure that pension would start only after having the detzilc of Aadhar oftheneficiaries in the cvstem",

Further, it may be ensured that the reconciliation process is completed as soon as report is made available for the same to concerned ROs: Corrective action shall be promptly taken for pending/rejected/failed transactions and as far as possible, these should be processed in next daily/weekly scroll after corrective action: 11. As the required Software for full scale CPPS is under development, till then, schedule for CPPS until further notice shall be as follows: Weekly pension payment: i. Scroll generation ii.
