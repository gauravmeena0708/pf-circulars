However, overlapping in services can occur due to genuine reasons and therefore the same should not be considered to be a disqualification per-se in effecting transfers. In this regard, the Pension Division vide reference (२) above has also provided the modalities of EPS entitlement of members having multiple account numbers. Therefore, the Transfer Claim requests are required to be processed by the Transferor ( Source) Office even though there may be overlapping services without returning or rejecting the same. Only in cases where a genuine need is felt to clarify the overlapping of service, would the claims be processed after obtaining the requisite clarification. Further, the instructions issued vide reference ( 1 ) above regarding the responsibility cast on Transferor (Source) Offices to verify all details to ensure error free transfer are re- iterated.

        "३. CHANGING ROLE AS FACILITATORS The role of Enforcement Officers has undergone significant changes in recent years With the increasing complexity of business and regulatory environments, inspectors are being called upon to play a more strategic role in ensuring compliance with laws and regulations. The following are some of the ways in which the role of inspectors has evolved in India: Increased emphasis on risk based inspection: Inspectors are now focused on identifying areas of highest risk and allocating their resources accordingly This requires a greater understanding of the business operations being inspected and the underlying risks and challenges. Use of technology: Inspectors are making use of technology such as mobile devices, data analytics, and other tools to streamline their work and improve the efficiency and accuracy of their inspections. Collaborative approach: Inspectors are working more closely with businesses to understand their operations and identify areas for improvement. This helps to build trust and reduce the risk of conflict between businesses and regulators. Greater focus on preventive measures: Inspectors are focusing on helping businesses identify and prevent problems before they occur rather than just detecting and correcting problems after the fact. Professional developmentः Inspectors are being encouraged to pursue ongoing professional development to stay current with developments in their field and to continuously improve their skills. In summary the role of inspectors in India has shifted from being purely enforcement- focused to being more collaborative, risk-based, and preventive in nature. Thus, Inspectors are now seen as partners or facilitators in promoting compliance and improving business",

Madam Sir , In order to simplify and to make the entire process of allotment and activation of UAN more robust, the following 3 facilities for Employees/Members have been introduced in the UMANG APP leveraging the Face Authentication TechnologY (FAT). 1. Direct UAN Allotment and Activation २. UAN Activation for Existing UANs 3 Face Authentication Service for Existing Activated UANs For availing this facility, the only requirement would be to download the UMANG App and Aadhaar Face RD App from Playstore The above facility can be availed by the Members themselves using their smartphones without any intervention of EPFO/Employers. Facility is also available for downloading e-UAN card PDF for handing over to Employer for onboarding with EPFO. The benefits that would accrue to members using FAT include foolproof validation of Aadhaar data as all data of user is pre- populated directly from Aadhaar database and completion of UAN activation process during UAN generation itself. There would be no requirement for initiation of UAN activation process afresh By availing this facility member would gain immediate access to EPFO services such as passbook viewing, KYC updates, claim submission etc. A detailed User Manual in this regard is enclosed herewith.
