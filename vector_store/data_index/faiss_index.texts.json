However, overlapping in services can occur due to genuine reasons and therefore the same should not be considered to be a disqualification per-se in effecting transfers. In this regard, the Pension Division vide reference (२) above has also provided the modalities of EPS entitlement of members having multiple account numbers. Therefore, the Transfer Claim requests are required to be processed by the Transferor ( Source) Office even though there may be overlapping services without returning or rejecting the same. Only in cases where a genuine need is felt to clarify the overlapping of service, would the claims be processed after obtaining the requisite clarification. Further, the instructions issued vide reference ( 1 ) above regarding the responsibility cast on Transferor (Source) Offices to verify all details to ensure error free transfer are re- iterated.
